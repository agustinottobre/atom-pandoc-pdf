-   Pandoc/PDF reference
    -   Pandoc's Markdown
    -   metadata and template variables for latex/beamer/html/ms
    -   useful defaults file settings
    -   more compact format

***

-   show selected format in toolbar

-   de/serialize?

    don't know how:

    -   there would have to be a way to get an ID from an editor and an editor from an ID (URI is buffer- not editor-specific)

    -   it would have to be ensured on deserialization of a PandocPdfView object that the corresponding editor has already been deserialized.

    -   or hook into observeTextEditors or observeActiveTextEditor?

-   canonical Pandoc icon, if and when jgm decides
